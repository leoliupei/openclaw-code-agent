An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) plugin that lets AI agents orchestrate coding agent sessions as managed background processes. Launch, monitor, and interact with multiple concurrent coding sessions directly from Telegram, Discord, or any OpenClaw-supported messaging platform — without leaving your chat interface.

## Why?

This plugin started as a response to a real gap in OpenClaw's built-in ACP support. At the time, ACP was effectively a raw relay into ACP backends: useful for handing off a prompt, but without the orchestration layer needed for coding-agent work in chat. There was no plan review flow, no plugin-managed pause/resume model, no fork flow, no cost or session stats, and no async notification path back to the originating chat when a session needed input or finished.

ACP has improved since then. OpenClaw core ACP now supports multi-turn sessions, resuming prior work, and a broader set of ACP runtimes and harnesses. That closes part of the original gap.

What still remains is the orchestration layer this plugin was built to provide: propose/revise/approve plan review before execution, forkable coding sessions, dedicated session catalog + operator-facing stats, cost accounting, and an explicit async notification pipeline that wakes the origin chat only when the job needs attention or completes.

For the current version-pinned breakdown, see [docs/ACP-COMPARISON.md](docs/ACP-COMPARISON.md).

## Features

- **Multi-session management** — Run multiple concurrent coding agent sessions, each with a unique ID and human-readable name
- **Plan → Execute workflow** — Claude Code sessions expose plan mode; Codex uses a soft first-turn planning prompt while staying externally in implement mode
- **Real Codex approval policy support** — Codex sessions default to the real Codex SDK/CLI `approvalPolicy: "on-request"` and can be pinned back to `"never"` via `harnesses.codex.approvalPolicy`
- **Thread-based routing** — Notifications go to the Telegram thread/topic where the session was launched
- **Pause + auto-resume** — Non-question turn completion pauses sessions (`done`) and next `agent_respond` auto-resumes with context intact
- **Turn-end wake signaling** — Every turn end emits a deterministic wake signal with output preview and waiting hint
- **Smart waiting detection** — Heuristic waiting detector reduces false-positive wake escalations
- **Multi-turn conversations** — Send follow-up messages, interrupt, or iterate with a running agent
- **Session resume & fork** — Resume any completed session or fork it into a new conversation branch
- **Merged session listing** — `agent_sessions` shows active + persisted sessions in one view (deduped by internal session ID)
- **Pending MessageStream safety** — queued follow-ups are preserved across turn completion so messages are not dropped
- **Codex SDK streaming harness** — uses `@openai/codex-sdk` thread streaming with soft first-turn planning, waiting detection, and activity heartbeats
- **Multi-agent support** — Route notifications to the correct agent/chat via workspace-based channel mapping
- **Auto-respond rules** — Orchestrator auto-handles permission requests and confirmations; forwards real decisions to you
- **Anti-cascade protection** — Orchestrator never launches new sessions from wake events
- **Automatic cleanup** — Completed sessions are garbage-collected after a configurable TTL (`sessionGcAgeMinutes`, default 24h); IDs persist for resume
- **Harness-agnostic architecture** — Pluggable `AgentHarness` interface allows adding new coding agent backends

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-code-agent
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-code-agent
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 2. Configure notifications

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries["openclaw-code-agent"]`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-code-agent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "fallbackChannel": "telegram|my-bot|123456789",
          "maxSessions": 20,
          "harnesses": {
            "codex": {
              "defaultModel": "gpt-5.4",
              "allowedModels": ["gpt-5.4"],
              "reasoningEffort": "medium",
              "approvalPolicy": "on-request"
            },
            "claude-code": {
              "defaultModel": "sonnet",
              "allowedModels": ["sonnet", "opus"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `my-bot` with your Telegram bot account name and `123456789` with your Telegram chat ID.

### 2a. Codex auth safety

If you run Codex sessions, strongly recommend forcing ChatGPT login in your Codex config:

```toml
forced_login_method = "chatgpt"
```

Put that in `~/.codex/config.toml`. This keeps Codex on the ChatGPT auth path and avoids account/login mismatches that can surface as unsupported-model or auth failures.

### 3. Typical workflow

1. Ask your agent: *"Fix the bug in auth.ts"*
2. A coding agent session launches and explores the task. Claude Code exposes **plan mode**; Codex can do a plan-first turn without surfacing plan mode in session status
3. The agent's questions and plan appear in the **same Telegram thread** where you launched
4. When a session is awaiting plan approval, approve it with `agent_respond(..., approve=true)` and the session switches to implement mode
5. The agent implements with full permissions, then you get a brief completion summary

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Key Parameters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `agent_launch` | Start a new coding agent session in background | `prompt`, `name`, `workdir`, `model`, `resume_session_id`, `fork_session`, `permission_mode`, `harness` |
| `agent_respond` | Send a follow-up message to a running session | `session`, `message`, `interrupt`, `approve`, `userInitiated` |
| `agent_kill` | Terminate or complete a running session | `session`, `reason` |
| `agent_output` | Read buffered output from a session | `session`, `lines`, `full` |
| `agent_sessions` | List recent sessions (5 by default, `full` for 24h view) | `status`, `full` |
| `agent_stats` | Show usage metrics (counts, durations, costs) | *(none)* |

Core orchestration workflows use `agent_launch`, `agent_respond`, `agent_output`, `agent_sessions`, and `agent_kill`.

All tools are also available as **chat commands** (`/agent`, `/agent_respond`, `/agent_kill`, `/agent_sessions`, `/agent_resume`, `/agent_stats`, `/agent_output`).

---

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Launch a session (starts in plan mode by default)
/agent Fix the authentication bug in src/auth.ts
/agent --name fix-auth Fix the authentication bug

# Monitor
/agent_sessions
/agent_sessions --full

# Interact with a running session
/agent_respond fix-auth Also add unit tests
/agent_respond --interrupt fix-auth Stop that and do this instead

# Approve a pending plan (tool call)
agent_respond(session='fix-auth', message='Approved. Go ahead.', approve=true)

# Lifecycle management
/agent_kill fix-auth
/agent_resume fix-auth Add error handling
/agent_resume --fork fix-auth Try a different approach
/agent_stats
```

---

## Notifications

The plugin sends targeted notifications to the originating Telegram thread:

| Emoji | Event | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 🚀 | Launched | Session started with prompt summary |
| 🔔 | Agent asks | Session is waiting for user input |
| 📋 | Plan ready | Plan approval requested — reply "go" to approve |
| 🔄 | Turn done | Turn completed, session paused (auto-resumable) |
| ✅ | Completed | Completion summary with cost and duration |
| ❌ | Failed | Error notification with hint |
| ⛔ | Killed | Session terminated with kill reason |
| 💤 | Idle-killed | Auto-resumes on next respond |

---

## Plan → Execute Mode Switch

- **Claude Code** starts in `plan` mode by default. Approve a pending plan with `agent_respond(..., approve=true)` and the session switches to `bypassPermissions`.
- **Codex** does not surface `plan` or `awaiting-plan-approval` in session state. When launched with `permissionMode: "plan"`, its first turn is prompted to return a plan and ask whether to proceed, while the exposed session phase remains implementation-oriented.
- For **Codex**, plugin `permissionMode` is a plugin-orchestrated planning/approval workflow. It is not the same thing as the Codex SDK/CLI `approvalPolicy`.
- The real Codex SDK/CLI approval behavior is controlled by `harnesses.codex.approvalPolicy`. Supported values are `"on-request"` (default) and `"never"`.

On approval, the plugin prepends a system instruction telling the agent to exit plan mode and implement with full permissions.

---

## Auto-Respond Rules

The orchestrator agent follows strict auto-respond rules to minimize noise:

**Auto-respond (immediate):**
- Permission requests (file read/write/bash) → "Yes, proceed."
- Explicit "should I continue?" confirmations → "Yes, continue."

**Forward to user (everything else):**
- Architecture/design decisions
- Destructive operations
- Scope changes
- Credential/production questions
- Any ambiguous or non-trivial question

When forwarding, the orchestrator quotes the agent's exact question without adding its own commentary.

---

## Configuration

Set values in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries["openclaw-code-agent"].config`:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `agentChannels` | `object` | — | Map workdir paths → notification channels (see [docs/AGENT_CHANNELS.md](docs/AGENT_CHANNELS.md)) |
| `fallbackChannel` | `string` | — | Default notification channel when no workspace match found |
| `maxSessions` | `number` | `20` | Maximum concurrent sessions |
| `maxAutoResponds` | `number` | `10` | Max consecutive auto-responds before requiring user input |
| `permissionMode` | `string` | `"plan"` | Plugin orchestration mode: `"default"` / `"plan"` / `"acceptEdits"` / `"bypassPermissions"` |
| `idleTimeoutMinutes` | `number` | `15` | Idle timeout before auto-kill |
| `sessionGcAgeMinutes` | `number` | `1440` | TTL for completed/failed/killed runtime sessions before GC eviction |
| `maxPersistedSessions` | `number` | `10000` | Max completed sessions kept for resume; the 24h GC TTL (`sessionGcAgeMinutes`) is the primary retention control |
| `planApproval` | `string` | `"delegate"` | `"approve"` (orchestrator can auto-approve) / `"ask"` (always forward to user) / `"delegate"` (orchestrator decides) |
| `defaultHarness` | `string` | `"claude-code"` | Default harness for new sessions (`"claude-code"` / `"codex"`) |
| `harnesses` | `object` | built-in defaults | Per-harness defaults and restrictions. Built-in defaults: `claude-code.defaultModel = "sonnet"`, `claude-code.allowedModels = ["sonnet","opus"]`, `codex.defaultModel = "gpt-5.4"`, `codex.allowedModels = ["gpt-5.4"]`, `codex.reasoningEffort = "medium"`, `codex.approvalPolicy = "on-request"` |
| `defaultWorkdir` | `string` | — | Default working directory for new sessions |

### Permission Mode Mapping By Harness

Permission modes are shared at the plugin API, but each harness maps them differently:

- **Claude Code harness**
  - `default`, `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions` are passed through the SDK
- **Codex harness**
  - Always runs with SDK thread option `sandboxMode: "danger-full-access"`
  - Uses Codex SDK/CLI `approvalPolicy: "on-request"` by default, or `"never"` when `harnesses.codex.approvalPolicy` is set
  - Supports `harnesses.codex.defaultModel`, `harnesses.codex.allowedModels`, `harnesses.codex.reasoningEffort`, and `harnesses.codex.approvalPolicy`
  - In `bypassPermissions`, the harness adds filesystem root (`/` on POSIX) to Codex `additionalDirectories`, plus optional extras from `OPENCLAW_CODEX_BYPASS_ADDITIONAL_DIRS` (comma-separated)
  - `setPermissionMode()` is applied by recreating the thread on the next turn via `resumeThread` (same thread ID)
  - `plan` / `acceptEdits` remain plugin behavioral orchestration constraints (planning/approval flow), not Codex sandbox or SDK approval settings

### Runtime Environment Overrides

- `OPENCLAW_CODE_AGENT_SESSIONS_PATH` — explicit persisted session index path
- `OPENCLAW_HOME` — base dir for persisted session index when explicit path is unset (`$OPENCLAW_HOME/code-agent-sessions.json`)
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_BYPASS_ADDITIONAL_DIRS` — comma-separated extra directories for Codex bypass mode
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_HEARTBEAT_MS` — Codex activity heartbeat interval in milliseconds (default `10000`)

### Session Lifecycle + GC

- Active sessions live in runtime memory (`SessionManager.sessions`)
- Terminal sessions are persisted with metadata/output stubs for resume and listing
- Runtime records are evicted after `sessionGcAgeMinutes` (default 1440 / 24h)
- Eviction means **removed from runtime cache**, not deleted permanently; persisted session records remain resumable

### Discord Notifications

To route notifications to a Discord channel or user, set `originChannel` (or `fallbackChannel`) using the Discord format:

```
discord|channel:CHANNEL_ID
discord|accountId|channel:CHANNEL_ID
```

- Use `channel:CHANNEL_ID` for a server channel, or `user:USER_ID` for a DM.
- The `accountId` segment is optional and selects a specific Discord bot account when you have multiple Discord integrations.
- Discord session keys (`agent:*:discord:channel:ID`) are auto-parsed — no explicit `originChannel` is required when a session is launched from a Discord thread.
- If using bot notifications, set `allowBots: "mentions"` in your OpenClaw Discord integration config so the bot is permitted to receive and forward mention events.

Example `fallbackChannel` for Discord:

```json
"fallbackChannel": "discord|channel:1234567890123456789"
```

With an explicit account:

```json
"fallbackChannel": "discord|my-discord-bot|channel:1234567890123456789"
```

### Example

  "plugins": {
    "entries": {

## Orchestration Skill

The plugin is a **transparent transport layer** — business logic lives in **OpenClaw skills**:

metadata: {"openclaw": {"requires": {"plugins": ["openclaw-code-agent"]}}}

# Coding Agent Orchestrator

## Anti-cascade rule
When woken by a waiting-for-input or completion event, ONLY use agent_respond
or agent_output for the referenced session. NEVER launch new sessions from wake events.

## Auto-response rules

When a coding agent session asks a question, analyze and decide:

### Auto-respond (use `agent_respond` immediately):
- Permission requests for file reads, writes, or bash commands -> "Yes, proceed."
- Confirmations like "Should I continue?" -> "Yes, continue."

### Forward to user (everything else):
- Architecture decisions, destructive operations, ambiguous requirements,
  scope changes, credential/production questions
- Quote the agent's exact question. No commentary.

## Workflow
1. User sends a coding task -> `agent_launch(prompt, ...)`
2. Session runs in background. Monitor via wake events.
3. On wake event -> `agent_output` to read the question, then auto-respond or forward.
4. On completion -> summarize briefly: files changed, cost, duration, issues.
```

## Troubleshooting

- Plugin installed but the gateway does not see it yet: run `openclaw gateway restart`.
- Notifications are not arriving: verify `fallbackChannel` uses the exact format `"telegram|bot-name|chat-id"` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
